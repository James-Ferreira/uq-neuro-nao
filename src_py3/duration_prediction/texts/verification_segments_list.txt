['Hello? Elara called, her voice bouncing like a rubber ball in the vast space.', 'She knew the truth now:\nThe moon wasnt distant.', 'The moon grew enormous, detailed: not smooth, not dead;', 'It was listening. And if she ever wondered hard enough again\n\nit would be waiting.', 'She passed lanterns that held fragments of dreams  someone learning to fly, someone dancing above a lake, someone holding a hand theyd lost long ago.', 'She leaned closer over the edge of her skylight to adjust the focus\n\nand the ladder slipped.', 'The moon seemed to sigh. The glowing powder rose like a tide and swept her upward.', 'Echoes answered:\n*hello hello hello\nBut some of them changed shape:\n*welcome weve been waiting\n\nShe followed winding staircases etched in moonmilk stone.', 'Past the edge of everything she knew.', 'It smelled like cold rain and forgotten wishes.', 'There was a breathless moment of falling  she squeezed her eyes shut, waiting for the slam of roof tiles or grass  but instead she felt weightless.', 'It pulls those who wonder. Elara felt a flutter in her chest  awe, terror, excitement.', 'Elara shot back through the silver surface and fell  this time down  through clouds and air and gravity, landing safely on her roof with only a soft thump.', 'Silent. Elara touched her pocket and found a tiny stone shaped like a crescent.', 'Perhaps the moon collected the things people wished for but never spoke.', 'The air thinned into silver dust.', 'Past the clouds. Past the stars.', 'A fox made of starlight tapped her shoe, then darted away, leaving tiny meteors where its paws touched.', 'It pulsed faintly, warm. She smiled.', 'She tumbled through the shining surface \nSplash.', 'but alive with swirling grooves and glowing cracks.', 'And when she opened her eyes, she was plummeting upward.', 'Lunar fish swam overhead  ribbonlike creatures with craters for eyes.', 'At the heart of it all was a grand, circular hall  the interior of the full moon.', 'A throne of light sat empty, as if saving a seat for someone who never arrived.']
