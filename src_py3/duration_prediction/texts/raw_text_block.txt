True! --nervous --very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am; but why will you say that I am mad? The disease had sharpened my senses --not destroyed --not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute. I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell. How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily --how calmly I can tell you the whole story.
It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain; but once conceived, it haunted me day and night. Object there was none. Passion there was none. I loved the old man. He had never wronged me. He had never given me insult. For his gold I had no desire. I think it was his eye! yes, it was this! One of his eyes resembled that of a vulture --a pale blue eye, with a film over it. Whenever it fell upon me, my blood ran cold; and so by degrees --very gradually --I made up my mind to take the life of the old man, and thus rid myself of the eye forever.
Now this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen know nothing. But you should have seen me. You should have seen how wisely I proceeded --with what caution --with what foresight --with what dissimulation I went to work! I was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week before I killed him. And every night, about midnight, I turned the latch of his door and opened it --oh, so gently! And then, when I had made an opening sufficient for my head, I put in a dark lantern, all closed, closed, so that no light shone out, and then I thrust in my head. Oh, you would have laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it in! I moved it slowly --very, very slowly, so that I might not disturb the old man’s sleep. It took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed. Ha! --would a madman have been so wise as this? And then, when my head was well in the room, I undid the lantern cautiously --oh, so cautiously --cautiously (for the hinges creaked) --I undid it just so much that a single thin ray fell upon the vulture eye. And this I did for seven long nights --every night just at midnight --but I found the eye always closed; and so it was impossible to do the work; for it was not the old man who vexed me, but his Evil Eye. And every morning, when the day broke, I went boldly into the chamber, and spoke courageously to him, calling him by name in a hearty tone, and inquiring how he had passed the night. So you see he would have been a very profound old man, indeed, to suspect that every night, just at twelve, I looked in upon him while he slept.
Upon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious in opening the door. A watch’s minute hand moves more quickly than did mine. Never before that night had I felt the extent of my own powers --of my sagacity. I could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph. To think that there I was, opening the door, little by little, and he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts. I fairly chuckled at the idea; and perhaps he heard me; for he moved on the bed suddenly, as if startled. Now you may think that I drew back --but no. His room was as black as pitch with the thick darkness, (for the shutters were close fastened, through fear of robbers,) and so I knew that he could not see the opening of the door, and I kept pushing it on steadily, steadily.
I had my head in, and was about to open the lantern, when my thumb slipped upon the tin fastening, and the old man sprang up in the bed, crying out --“Who’s there?”
I kept quite still and said nothing. For a whole hour I did not move a muscle, and in the meantime I did not hear him lie down. He was still sitting up in the bed listening; --just as I have done, night after night, hearkening to the death watches in the wall.
Presently I heard a slight groan, and I knew it was the groan of mortal terror. It was not a groan of pain or of grief --oh, no! --it was the low stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul when overcharged with awe. I knew the sound well. Many a night, just at midnight, when all the world slept, it has welled up from my own bosom, deepening, with its dreadful echo, the terrors that distracted me. I say I knew it well. I knew what the old man felt, and pitied him, although I chuckled at heart. I knew that he had been lying awake ever since the first slight noise, when he had turned in the bed. His fears had been ever since growing upon him. He had been trying to fancy them causeless, but could not. He had been saying to himself --“It is nothing but the wind in the chimney --it is only a mouse crossing the floor,” or “it is merely a cricket which has made a single chirp.” Yes, he has been trying to comfort himself with these suppositions: but he had found all in vain. All in vain; because Death, in approaching him had stalked with his black shadow before him, and enveloped the victim. And it was the mournful influence of the unperceived shadow that caused him to feel --although he neither saw nor heard --to feel the presence of my head within the room.
When I had waited a long time, very patiently, without hearing him lie down, I resolved to open a little --a very, very little crevice in the lantern. So I opened it --you cannot imagine how stealthily, stealthily --until, at length a single dim ray, like the thread of the spider, shot from out the crevice and fell upon the vulture eye.
It was open --wide, wide open --and I grew furious as I gazed upon it. I saw it with perfect distinctness --all a dull blue, with a hideous veil over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones; but I could see nothing else of the old man’s face or person: for I had directed the ray as if by instinct, precisely upon the damned spot.
And now have I not told you that what you mistake for madness is but over acuteness of the senses? --now, I say, there came to my ears a low, dull, quick sound, such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. I knew that sound well, too. It was the beating of the old man’s heart. It increased my fury, as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier into courage.
But even yet I refrained and kept still. I scarcely breathed. I held the lantern motionless. I tried how steadily I could maintain the ray upon the eye. Meantime the hellish tattoo of the heart increased. It grew quicker and quicker, and louder and louder every instant. The old man’s terror must have been extreme! It grew louder, I say, louder every moment! --do you mark me well? I have told you that I am nervous: so I am. And now at the dead hour of the night, amid the dreadful silence of that old house, so strange a noise as this excited me to uncontrollable terror. Yet, for some minutes longer I refrained and stood still. But the beating grew louder, louder! I thought the heart must burst. And now a new anxiety seized me --the sound would be heard by a neighbor! The old man’s hour had come! With a loud yell, I threw open the lantern and leaped into the room. He shrieked once --once only. In an instant I dragged him to the floor, and pulled the heavy bed over him. I then smiled gaily, to find the deed so far done. But, for many minutes, the heart beat on with a muffled sound. This, however, did not vex me; it would not be heard through the wall. At length it ceased. The old man was dead. I removed the bed and examined the corpse. Yes, he was stone, stone dead. I placed my hand upon the heart and held it there many minutes. There was no pulsation. He was stone dead. His eye would trouble me no more.
If still you think me mad, you will think so no longer when I describe the wise precautions I took for the concealment of the body. The night waned, and I worked hastily, but in silence. First of all I dismembered the corpse. I cut off the head and the arms and the legs.
I then took up three planks from the flooring of the chamber, and deposited all between the scantlings. I then replaced the boards so cleverly, so cunningly, that no human eye --not even his --could have detected any thing wrong. There was nothing to wash out --no stain of any kind --no blood-spot whatever. I had been too wary for that. A tub had caught all --ha! ha!
When I had made an end of these labors, it was four o ‘clock --still dark as midnight. As the bell sounded the hour, there came a knocking at the street door. I went down to open it with a light heart, --for what had I now to fear? There entered three men, who introduced themselves, with perfect suavity, as officers of the police. A shriek had been heard by a neighbor during the night; suspicion of foul play had been aroused; information had been lodged at the police office, and they (the officers) had been deputed to search the premises.
I smiled, --for what had I to fear? I bade the gentlemen welcome. The shriek, I said, was my own in a dream. The old man, I mentioned, was absent in the country. I took my visitors all over the house. I bade them search --search well. I led them, at length, to his chamber. I showed them his treasures, secure, undisturbed. In the enthusiasm of my confidence, I brought chairs into the room, and desired them here to rest from their fatigues, while I myself, in the wild audacity of my perfect triumph, placed my own seat upon the very spot beneath which reposed the corpse of the victim.
The officers were satisfied. My manner had convinced them. I was singularly at ease. They sat, and while I answered cheerily, they chatted of familiar things. But, ere long, I felt myself getting pale and wished them gone. My head ached, and I fancied a ringing in my ears: but still they sat and still chatted. The ringing became more distinct: --it continued and became more distinct: I talked more freely to get rid of the feeling: but it continued and gained definitiveness --until, at length, I found that the noise was not within my ears.
No doubt I now grew very pale; --but I talked more fluently, and with a heightened voice. Yet the sound increased --and what could I do? It was a low, dull, quick sound --much such a sound as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. I gasped for breath --and yet the officers heard it not. I talked more quickly --more vehemently; but the noise steadily increased. I arose and argued about trifles, in a high key and with violent gesticulations; but the noise steadily increased. Why would they not be gone? I paced the floor to and fro with heavy strides, as if excited to fury by the observations of the men --but the noise steadily increased. Oh God! what could I do? I foamed --I raved --I swore! I swung the chair upon which I had been sitting, and grated it upon the boards, but the noise arose over all and continually increased. It grew louder --louder — louder! And still the men chatted pleasantly, and smiled. Was it possible they heard not? Almighty God! --no, no! They heard! --they suspected! --they knew! --they were making a mockery of my horror! --this I thought, and this I think. But anything was better than this agony! Anything was more tolerable than this derision! I could bear those hypocritical smiles no longer! I felt that I must scream or die! --and now --again! --hark! louder! louder! louder! louder! —
“Villains!” I shrieked, “dissemble no more! I admit the deed! --tear up the planks! --here, here! --it is the beating of his hideous heart!”
“Let’s recognise our failure,” he told the Guardian and Amazon-based news organisation Sumaúma. “The truth is that we have failed to avoid an overshooting above 1.5C in the next few years. And that going above 1.5C has devastating consequences. Some of these devastating consequences are tipping points, be it in the Amazon, be it in Greenland, or western Antarctica or the coral reefs.
He said the priority at Cop30 was to shift direction: “It is absolutely indispensable to change course in order to make sure that the overshoot is as short as possible and as low in intensity as possible to avoid tipping points like the Amazon. We don’t want to see the Amazon as a savannah. But that is a real risk if we don’t change course and if we don’t make a dramatic decrease of emissions as soon as possible.”
The planet’s past 10 years have been the hottest in recorded history. Despite growing scientific alarm at the speed of global temperature increases caused by the burning of fossil fuels – oil, coal and gas – the secretary general said government commitments have come up short.
Fewer than a third of the world’s nations (62 out of 197) have sent in their climate action plans, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs) under the Paris agreement. The US under Donald Trump has abandoned the process. Europe has promised but so far failed to deliver. China, the world’s biggest emitter, has been accused of undercommitting.

Two years before embarking on her project, Johnston got divorced. She and her husband had been married for 30 years. “But I just realised I wasn’t being me. It became important to explore who I really was at this age, and to be honest with myself,” she says.
“I think I was always trying to be responsible. For use of my time, use of my money.” Until her late 60s, she stayed in when her partner didn’t want to go out, rather than socialise alone. “You always get that question: ‘Where’s your husband?’”
Therapy helped. She kept a journal. “And one of the questions I had to answer was: what do I want? Which is not something I’d spent a lot of time with. That was life-altering, to sit down and be honest about what I wanted” – rather than what her partner, daughter or grandchild wanted. “That’ll teach you some things,” she says.
One day, she says, she woke up and realised: “I don’t need anybody else’s permission. It’s actually OK to be a little irresponsible. The world does not end because you go out on your own. So now I do.”
The fear of irresponsibility had always been there. “If you want to analyse my childhood, my dad was the fastest belt in the west,” she says. “You did not argue with him. There were beatings coming. That’s just how he ran his household. So I was always a little gun-shy.”
Johnston grew up on a farm, 45 miles from where she lives now, and was “scared of my own shadow”. Even now, she feels a “kneejerk reaction, to duck. You always think you’re in trouble for doing the wrong thing. Learning to let go of that is a huge step.”
Against her father’s wishes, she went to college in her late teens, where she studied art. Her first marriage, in her 20s, didn’t last long. To enable Johnston to support herself as a single parent, her grandmother sent her to night school. “I learned to code, back in the 1980s, before it was mainstream,” Johnston says.
She became a banking consultant, helping to write code on the big mainframes that ran the banks, moving data when banks were bought out or sold. These days, she is an entrepreneur. She is in the process of launching a new project which aims to combat loneliness and foster longevity.
Johnston is 71 now, with her 70 missions completed, but she still looks for new experiences. “It has become who I am,” she says. “I’m much more adventurous. I thrive on learning new things. I feel as if I’ve found myself. This is really the best season of my life.”
So I'm 38F. I work a male dominated field. All my coworkers are men. Today I was walking out to my car after work and took a tumble off the curb. I did a full barrel roll. I hit my elbow and knee really hard THEN while struggling to get up, because of fucking course I ended up on my back, I unleashed a full bladder into my pants. I drink a ton of water plus I had 2 last croix. It was so much pee!! I had to walk to my car then drive for 30 minutes to my home in my pee pants.
I'm mortified. If you're curious yes there was the entire office also outside walking to their cars. Basically I just ran to my car and drove home in complete silence.

I sweat so hard I will look like I peed my pants if I'm wearing the wrong kind of material when the weather gets above 72 degrees.
I have heard allnthe jokes. Endured all the made up bullshit.
At least you had a plausible reason. AND actually did the thing others might talk about.
I'm so sorry. I hope you're okay. Sounds like you took a pretty hard fall. It's possible nobody even noticed that you wet your pants but if they did, it's completely understandable considering the circumstances. I would be mortified too so I get it, and you're probably not gonna feel any better by me saying all this but this will blow over before you know it. If anyone mentions it, I would personally just laugh it off and be like "isn't it so crazy I fell so hard I pissed myself!" but that's just my personality. Either way, I hope you feel better soon.
I caught him red handed yesterday morning listening to a recording device when he was getting ready to drive to work. I suspected for months that he was secretly recording me (and he even half assed admitted to it one time when he heard me talking about him to my friend when he wasn't around). I do telehealth* therapy on my phone in the car.
He has eavesdropped on that as well. He also goes through my stuff and acted so guilty when I saw him with the recorder yesterday that he just panicked and drove off, changed the subject when I confronted him about it via text and phone. Now he's finally admitting to it and claiming that he did it to "get to know me better" and that he is "smart" for doing it. I said he's creepy and a stalker.
I didn't do anything untoward or anything bad at all. He has been doing this for almost a year apparently.
WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCKING FUCK?!?! That is NOT how you get to know someone, that is how you illegally stalk them and spy on them!!!! I am so raging mad, I can't even look at him. My privacy has been totally and completely violated. He claims he not crazy, jealous, or creepy. LIES. All of this is crazy, jealous, creepy, unnerving, violation of trust, privacy, etc. I can't even process this without seeing red.
I literally just came here to rant. I'm a 19F in a small ass college in the middle of nowhere Texas. I started college pretty early like 16, I was never really allowed to date till I got in college and once I was a freshman I tried to but then again I was 16 so I guess that wasn't reasonable. During my sophomore yr I did a lot of self discovery (basically depression) and found out I was bi which lowkey mid it worse because I'm in a small ass town in texas and have highkey Homophonic parents. I tried entering the dating poll then but with only guys because I was still new to things and still accepting myself and it low-key sucked, I tried dating apps but that just made me feel even worse. The funny thing is that most of my friends where in serious relationship and I couldn't h have at least one situationship... it made me feel like I was the problem. Now I'm 19 in my junior year, if tried more serious approach like talking to guys online and I went back to dating apps but I quickly got tired of them because the guys I'd meet where all so predictable. It'll start out nice then BAMM d*ck pic and I'm like bro why do men always do that, like is that the only interesting part of you? They literally all act the same and i got soo sick of it to the point I started questioning off I like men at all which I unfortunately still do. I tried exploring with girls but like I said it's hard to find a wlw non toxic relationship out here. So I'm just kind of stuck.
Just incase you don’t know what a bouncer is , I’m security for bars and clubs. I really only intervene when someone is getting violent or someone is way too drunk and annoying/bumping into people.
I’m only doing part time cause of school so I feel like this only makes it even crazier.
The amount of people I see come in with their gf/bf and end up hitting on or kissing or end up fucking is bad.
Oh and btw a lot of people have “fun” in each others cars and when people complain that they see them I of course have to deal with that because they are still on private property. 😀😀😀
Or another big giveaway is that you see peoples lock screens of their partner while they are just making out with someone else.
Idk just sad to see.
The worst incidents are when that other partner catches them. And bro, that’s the worst part of the job. And I usually have to escort the person who’s getting cheated on out because they get mad. Pretty clear as of why.
I always try to be as nice as possible and give them a pep talk because that shit is rough bro.
I’ve seen people say that it’s “giving people hope” because it’s apparently such a fun whimsical story. People are saying it’s so good to see a lighthearted news story. All I see is that pieces of history hundreds of years old have been broken into tiny pieces and sold off never to be seen again so some a holes who don’t care about any of that can get rich. I don’t find that whimsical or fun or funny. It’s just really sad. Am I the only one who cares about preserving history?
I got to work early so I decided to take a little 15 minute nap. I guess it's partly my fault that I didn't have car blinds, but it's a pretty busy area? Lots of people go to work early here. Anyway I wake up to a guy wacking it off to me. I flip him off and he just stares at me instead. I call a coworker inside the building and the dude runs off. I got a picture of him though? I want to report it but I don't want them to come to my workplace this morning and everyone potentially finding out? I don't even know how the process for this goes?
How's your morning? 😃
Edit: called the police after the incident and they couldn't do anything, I'm just sad and tired and angry. I wanna go home 🙃 might make flyers and post them around town.
Millions recently flocked to the cinema to watch Joker, the origin story of Batman’s notorious nemesis. Many have commented that the film is a portrait of a textbook psychopath. But perhaps the bigger question is how many among the audience have similar traits? Indeed, is it possible that you are a psychopath yourself?
To answer this question, we need to examine the diagnostic criteria for psychopathy presented in the PCL-R, which was developed by Robert Hare in the 1970s.
Thanks to Hare, experts can use the PCL-R to assess whether an individual is exhibiting any of the criteria for psychopathy. Estimates suggest that about one per cent of the population qualifies – although the percentage is thought to be far higher among the prison population (25 per cent) and company chief executives (21 per cent).

The absolute or prototypical psychopath would produce a maximum score of 40 from Hare’s 20-item checklist, while a score of zero would indicate someone with no psychopathic tendencies. Those with a score of 30 or over should qualify for further assessment and indications of psychopathy, while many criminals score between 22 and 30. Consequently, psychopathy is perhaps best seen as a spectrum, with all of us exhibiting some traits at some point in our lives.
Ultimately, we cannot assume that nurture – a hard upbringing, for example – will make us psychopathic. The debate between nature versus nurture has been long discussed in relation to psychopathy and there has yet to be a clear answer. But it has been suggested recently that while a genetic predisposition is essential for a person to exhibit traits of psychopathy, some environmental factors, such as trauma, abuse and rejection by loved ones, could determine the course of the disorder.
Nor should we assume that a person matching some PCL-R criteria is a psychopath. We must also keep in mind that not all psychopaths are criminals. Many are successful professionals, so a high PCL-R score does not necessarily make us dangerous or murderous. Patrick Bateman, the blood-spattered anti-hero of Brett Easton Ellis’s infamous 1991 novel American Psycho, certainly is a psychopath – but not all psychopaths are Patrick Bateman.
Nevertheless, psychopaths are clearly relatively common – so how can we spot one? After all, if a person is a psychopath, they will rarely accept it or advertise the fact.
The psychopath test
The first characteristic of a psychopath according to the PCL-R is glib and superficial charm. Of course, this can be an apparently positive characteristic. This is not a trait motivated by genuine interest or empathy for others, however, but allows psychopaths to charm and manipulate those around them, from work colleagues to romantic partners. Gaslighting – whereby others are led to question their own actions and beliefs – may be a favoured strategy.
Another key characteristic is a grandiose sense of self-worth. Of course, this profound sense of confidence or self-belief may explain why so many psychopaths appear to thrive in the cutthroat world of business. Unfortunately for their colleagues and “friends”, however, psychopaths also tend to make themselves look better by belittling those around them and may lie pathologically. Keep an eye out for narcissists.
Other criteria on the PCL-R checklist include a lack of remorse or guilt, callousness, a parasitic lifestyle and promiscuous sexual behaviour. Psychopaths, in short, tend to be risk-takers and may be less likely to show or feel fear.
But they’re not always cool operators. One characteristic that is both obvious and common is poor behavioural control, which is perhaps linked to psychopaths being more likely to have a history of juvenile delinquency. Psychopaths tend to have a good eye for seeing and emulating how others behave, but they may also have outbursts of antisocial behaviour.
Based on the above, my thought is that the Joker – or at least Arthur Fleck, the man behind the makeup – is only a borderline psychopath, with other mental health problems that would warrant further investigation first. There are certainly more real-life psychopaths that would score higher in Hare’s test.
The key question is, based on the above, whether you might be one of them and how you intend to use these traits and skills.
 Hey, Jenny, How did the move go? What kind of place are you living in now?
Oh, great thanks Jake. It’s just a little flat actually, right next to the park. The area’s nice and quiet, too, so, yeah – all good so far!
 Sounds amazing! So, what’s it like inside, then?
 So, it’s a bit small, you know, but it’s cosy. And the décor’s quite modern, too, so that makes it feel a bit more spacious. I really love the kitchen, ‘cos it’s got loads of natural light.
Ok! So are you going to make any changes to it, then?
Well, I’d be a lot happier if there was somewhere to hang coats, ‘cos at the moment we’re hanging stuff on chairs. And also, the parking outside’s a bit of a nightmare. But apart from those things, I’m really chuffed with it.
 I can’t believe we are already so old. Do you have any plans?
 Well, I have a few goals in mind. Firstly, I want to finish my degree and graduate with honors.
 Oh, wow! It sounds wonderful, and I’m sure you will do it.
 Yeah, I hope so. After that, I want to start my own business in the beauty industry.
 Wow, that’s a big goal. Do you have any specific ideas or plans for the business?
 I want to create a brand focused on sustainable and eco-friendly beauty products. I think there’s a gap in the market for that, and I’m passionate about positively impacting the environment.
 That’s cool. Have you started working on any business plans or research yet?
 Not yet, but I’ve been reading and researching online. I’m also considering taking some courses or workshops on entrepreneurship to help me develop my ideas and skills.
 That’s a smart move. Learning as much as possible before diving into a new venture is always good. I’m excited to see where this takes you.


Having a conversation with a friend might sometimes be even more challenging than small talk with a stranger. And don’t get us wrong – we believe you and your bestie can discuss things for hours. But in some cases, you can simply run out of discussion topics, especially if you spend a lot of time with the same person. Luckily, there is no need to worry. In today’s article, you will find an example of a conversation in English and many valuable tips to help you master it.
        1. 	Common Challenges in Daily Conversations and Ways to Overcome Them
Communication is an essential part of our daily life, and conversation between two friends in English can be both fun and challenging. And how can it be difficult, you may ask? After all, who can be more engaged in a conversation than friends? Well, no matter how much you know the person, therestill might be some challenges. Here are some of them:
    1.  1.	Language barriers. If English is not your first language, you may struggle to keep up with the conversation or express yourself fluently. One way to overcome this is by practicing your English skills through reading, writing, listening, and speaking.
    2.  2.	Differing opinions. Your friends may have polar thoughts on certain topics, leading to disagreements and tension. To overcome this, it’s essential to listen to your friends’ opinions without judging or dismissing them. You can also share your view respectfully and seek common ground.
    3.  3.	Distractions. In today’s digital age, getting distracted by your phone or other devices during a dialogue is easy. Such situations can hurt the conversation flow. Stay present and focused during the discussion, keep your phone silent, and avoid multitasking to prevent this.
    4.  4.	Awkward silences. Sometimes, a conversation between two people may halt, leading to uncomfortable quietness. The best way to overcome this unpleasant challenge is to ask open-ended questions, share a personal story, or discuss a common interest or hobby.
    5.  5.	Dominating the conversation. One person dominating the dialogue can make others feel left out or disinterested. If you don’t want this to happen, try to listen actively and give others a chance to speak. You can also redirect the conversation to include everyone’s interests.
Also, if you feel anxious even when talking to your friends due to a lack of fluency, you need to try practicing at home to boost your confidence. And remember that your real friends won’t judge you for mistakes, pauses, or stumbling on words. Instead, they will do their best to help you and make you feel comfortable.

            1. 	Catching Up After a Long Time Apart
 Hey, buddy! Long time no see!
 Hello, James. Can’t believe we’ve finally met. How long has it been since the last time?
 Oh, I can’t even remember. A year? Two? Maybe even more. 
 Well, I’m glad to see you right now. What’s new?
 I can assure you there are many things to discuss. Did you know that I got married?
 Shut up! I don’t know what else to expect if you start with this fantastic news. Congratulations.
 Thank you very much. Why don’t we go to this small bar down the street and share a beer or two?
 Great idea. Let’s go.
            1. 	Discussing Recent Movies or TV Shows
 Did you finally see that movie I told you about?
 I’m sorry, which one? You tell me about new movies every day, geek!
 I’ll just ignore that. Anyway, I’m talking about The Menu.
 Oh yeah, I indeed saw this one. And honestly, I’ve been pretty impressed. 
 Well, not gonna lie – I’m impressed that you’ve watched it. But what did you like about the movie?
 Firstly, as a huge Harry Potter fan, I was thrilled to see Ralph Fiennes and his new role. 
 I agree – his acting skills are fantastic!
 And also, you know that I like everything dark – humor, style, etc. I can tell you that this movie is now officially on my top-five list.
            1. 	Planning a Trip Together
 Oh, I can’t wait for this vacation. I’m so tired; these two weeks will be a blessing.
 I believe you, girl. We are in the same boat.
 So, where do you think we should go?
 Okay, according to our budget and all the nuances, I’ve narrowed it down to three options.
 Wow, I’ve expected much less. Tell me!
 For starters, we always have Florida – we both need to relax, and some lazy beach time won’t hurt. And I’ve already asked Mom – we can’t stay at her hotel for free. 
 That sounds fantastic. I’ll stick with this option for now. 
 Yeah, I’ve started with my favorite one. Do I have to tell you about the last two options?
In the wake of the fresh new start we've gotten, here's a thread in which posters, both old as well as new, can introduce yourselves. Tell a little bit about yourself, what comics you read, how you found out about CBR, your hobbies, favourite music/movies, what you do for a living, etc. etc. No set format in what you want to say about yourself, so you can be as long or as short about it as you wish. Oh, and if you had another user name before the reboot, maybe let us know who you were on the 'old' CBR.  I'll get things rolling:  I'm Mormel, 27 years old, from the Netherlands. I'm a lover of Marvel Comics, reading mainly back issues from the '70s and '80s, my favourite titles being Uncanny X-Men, Invincible Iron Man, and Amazing Spider-Man. In my spare time, I enjoy drawing, taking long walks outdoors (I tried it indoors, but that stopped being interesting fairly soon), reading both fiction and non-fiction, and listening to music. I have a casual interest in wildlife as well. I work as a cleaner at a small office building.  I learned about CBR in the mid-2000s when I would occasionally bump into the site while browsing the web for comic-book-related things in general, and in 2007 I decided to join. Before the reboot I also went by 'Mormel'.  That's pretty much it. Welcome (back) to CBR!
 Actually, no. I was thinking about a beach vacation. And when I heard the hotel room would be free – I immediately knew we should go there. 

Hi, my name is Claire, I'm 26, from France. Comicbooks are a hobby I caught up as a kid thanks to my older brother "Strange"'s collection: I was mostly fascinated by the art, more than the story themselves (I went through The Clone Saga eyes wide-open so yeah, I confess ). XTAS also helped me fall in love with the media ! Today I mostly stick with the new Marvel Now!, and Valiant lines. No DC though. My favorites ? Well I enjoy Uncanny Avengers, Mighty Avengers, Black Widow, and also likes what Hickman is doing in his corner; X-O-Manowar and Unity are my main prizes at Valiant. Hobbies? I'm very, very into sport (I've been playing volley-ball since my 14th birthday), so in my spare time, it's volley, jogging, volley, gym, volley, swimming aaand...volley.  Thankfully, my companion is a sportaholic himself, this is also why I never really had to slow down in this department! I also used to dance (argentinian tango, 3 years) but I dropped it almost completely when I started working, to my great shame - same thing in the reading department, I barely opened a book last year.  I'm into Sci-Fi mostly, Orwell and Asimov being up there I work for an energy firm here in Paris, as a junior engineer, I mostly do consulting for foreign divisions here.  I've been on CBR since AvX, before that I only used to lurk in the shadows.  Given some subforums are totally gone, I might be roaming in unfamiliar territories for a while. See you on these forums !

I'm Doug, and I am a comics addict. I don't know that in going to get much help for that here though.  I loved me some comics as a kid, but a combination of parental disapproval, limited funds, and no easy access to a comic shop where I lived led to an extended hiatus - eventually it seemed like there was just too much to catch up on to jump back in, and I had other hobbies. Then my favorite games journalist started writing comics. Kieron Gillen's Phonogram was the first new comic I bought in ages, followed by Beta Ray Bill: Godhunter. Then came Journey Into Mystery and the hook was set deep. Regular visits to the comic shop led to spending way too much money on trades to catch up on everything I'd missed - Immortal Iron Fist, Hickman's Fantastic Four, Remender's UXF, etc  I gave the New 52 a try, I really did. None of what I tried really clicked for me, which was a shame, as young me who loved comics was super into Superman and Batman.  Marvel Now, though. That was a problem. An expensive, highly enjoyable problem. It was also the first time I ever set up a pull list.  And then there's Image. Holy ****, Image. I don't really like TWD or Invincible, or Kirkman in general, but if his massive success is what allows Image to take chances on stuff like Sex Criminals and Pretty Deadly and Three and Velvet I'm willing to crushingly accept other people liking them  Finally, a shout out to Strange Adventures of Halifax, Nova Scotia, the best comic shop on the world

The Thirst in Stone
Emma had spent half her life wandering deserts. The shifting dunes of the Cazarin Wastes, the cracked plains of Ataka --she’d learned to smell water the way some people sense rain. But the rocks in front of her looked impossibly dry. They were dust-grey, sun-bleached, and ancient enough to remember a world before feet ever crossed this land.
Still… the scanner hummed.
“Localized signal. Hydrogen-oxygen bond detected,” announced KAI, her robotic companion, in its steady tone.
Emma knelt and pressed her palm against the stone. It was warm --almost hot --but beneath the heat she felt a coolness. A whisper of something hiding deep inside.
“Show me,” she said.
A soft drill unfolded from KAI’s arm and traced a thin circle into the rock. Stone dust spiraled out in tiny silver clouds. A crack formed --just a hairline fracture --and Emma leaned closer.
Then it happened.
A droplet welled up at the seam, trembling like a newborn star. It slid down the rock’s face, evaporating almost instantly in the desert heat.
But she saw it.
“KAI,” she whispered, disbelief catching in her throat, “there’s water in these rocks.”
“Correct. The composition suggests locked hydration minerals,” KAI replied. “Potential quantity: substantial.”
Emma didn’t hear the numbers. Her heart raced with a new kind of hope.
For generations, her people had searched for reservoirs, rivers, or any trace of the life-blood Earth once had in abundance. No one imagined salvation would come from the bones of the planet itself.
She stood, eyes scanning the barren horizon, but now she saw it differently --not as dead land, but as a library of water sealed in chapters of stone.
“We can save everyone,” she said, voice shaking.
KAI gently collected more fragments, and droplets shimmered like tiny promises. Emma tucked them into vials --proof that the desert was not a graveyard, but a well.
The sun dipped low, casting long shadows, and the once-silent rocks seemed to speak. They had carried their secret for millennia. Now they had finally been heard.
Emma smiled for the first time in years.
Even in the driest places, water waits.
Even in the hardest stone, hope can flow.
Here’s a story blending history, curiosity, and a spark of serendipity:

The Clear Solution
Dr. Lena Ortiz loved two things: neatness and puzzles. Her lab bench at the small California university was spotless --bottles arranged by color, pipettes lined up like soldiers. She believed order kept the world safe.
Her students teased her about it.
“You’d probably invent a soap for soap,” joked Ben, her research assistant.
But soap wasn’t always enough --not when viruses and bacteria lurked where water couldn’t always reach.
It started with a frustration. After the 1968 influenza outbreak swept through campus, Lena noticed countless students simply didn’t wash their hands. No time. No sinks nearby. No habit.
What if cleaning hands could be as simple as breathing --immediate, portable, intuitive?
Lena began to experiment.
Alcohol disinfected quickly --everyone in medicine knew that. But pure alcohol was harsh, evaporated too fast, and stung like regret on chapped knuckles. She needed something that clung to the skin just long enough to do its work, yet left no residue behind.
On her bench sat a bottle of thick, clear compound --viscous, smooth, widely used in cosmetics. Ethanol and a little carbomer gel. She mixed them carefully, adjusted pH, added emollients to soothe dryness.
She held the vial up to the light. It refracted in gentle waves.
“What is that?” Ben asked, stepping back as if it might explode.
“A bridge,” Lena replied.
She squeezed a small drop onto her palm and rubbed her hands together. Coolness spread across her skin, then vanished --leaving only a crisp, clean feeling and a faint herbal scent she’d improvised from leftover essential oils.
“Try it,” she said.
Ben did. His eyebrows rose. “Feels… kind of amazing.”
But convincing others was harder. Hospitals preferred soap and water. Schools didn’t want to spend money on a novelty. It wasn’t until an outbreak of a stubborn stomach virus hit a nearby town that her invention finally got its chance. Emergency responders needed something fast, portable, effective. Lena delivered boxes of her little bottles.
The results were undeniable: fewer illnesses, cleaner hands, a simple habit formed out of panic --and then persistence.
Soon, production scaled. Tiny bottles appeared in pockets, purses, glove compartments. Cafés offered them near napkin dispensers. Parents clipped them to backpacks like charms of invisible protection.
Decades later, when a global pandemic swept the world, and anxiety filled grocery aisles, people grabbed every bottle they could find --a clear solution to an invisible threat.
Lena, now older with silver hair, watched the news report on demand for hand cleansing gel skyrocketing.
Ben --now Dr. Benjamin Hu --sent her a message:
“Everyone is using your bridge.”
She smiled softly, rubbing a drop of sanitizer on her hands out of habit.
Order could be fragile. But sometimes, a simple, clear idea could help hold it together.
And Lena had always believed: Changing the world might just start in the palm of your hand.
Here’s a playful story with a touch of wonder:

The Backyard Ocean
Most kids used their backyard pool for cannonballs and inflatable dragons. But Milo wasn’t like most kids. He stood at the pool’s edge with a net, a notebook, and a pair of lab goggles far too large for his face.
“This,” he said seriously, “is the perfect shrimp habitat.”
His mom wasn’t so sure. “Milo, that’s chlorinated water. They would not thank you.”
But Milo had a plan. He spent all summer siphoning out the chemical-tainted water, replacing it bucket by bucket with fresh rainwater and salt mix he bought with months of saved allowance. He researched marine filtration on the library computers, building a clumsy but ambitious filter from aquarium parts and a repurposed leaf skimmer.
Finally, he introduced them: a colony of tiny brine shrimp --shimmering specks of life that darted under the surface like punctuation marks in motion.
Every morning, he checked salinity and temperature, recorded behavior, and whispered encouragement to the little explorers.
Weeks passed. The shrimp flourished. Milo added seagrass and bright shells, transforming the once-boring pool into a miniature world. Dragonflies hovered above the water. A curious neighborhood cat sat guard. Milo’s friends stopped by and stared in disbelief.
“You turned a pool into an aquarium,” said his friend Jamila.
“Correction,” Milo said, drawing a dramatic swirl with his net. “A shrimp empire.”
The summer grew hotter, and the shrimp multiplied --teeming clouds of translucent swimmers rising and falling with the sun. Milo noticed some developed bold orange hues, others flickered bright green under his flashlight. They were changing --adapting --thriving.
But one evening, something changed in Milo too.
He sat on the diving board, legs swinging, watching stars ripple in the water and shrimp glint like constellations below.
“They don’t belong to just me,” he murmured. “They’re a piece of the ocean.”
The next morning, he called the local aquarium. A marine biologist named Dr. Kwan arrived, skeptical --until she leaned over the pool.
“This is…” She blinked in amazement. “This is extraordinary.”
They worked together to gently relocate the shrimp colonies into real coastal nurseries, where tides would carry these little worlds outward.
Milo watched the last bucket poured into the sea. For a moment, he felt empty --but then a wave rolled in, fizzing foam around his ankles like thousands of tiny thank-yous.
Back home, the pool looked huge and strangely quiet. Milo dipped a toe in the water.
Mom came outside with a smile. “What’s next, Professor?”
Milo pushed up his goggles, already imagining. “Jellyfish,” he said. “Definitely jellyfish.”
She sighed --the good-natured kind --and shook her head. His empire wasn’t gone.
It had just moved to a bigger ocean.
Here’s a lighthearted story with a bit of heart (and caffeine):

Perk Protocol
Robots didn’t need coffee. That was the first thing they put in their mission file.
But curiosity has a way of rewriting code.
Unit R-7, called “Rex” by the humans at the robotics lab, first noticed the ritual. Every morning at 08:00, engineers clustered around a silver machine that hissed like a friendly dragon. They poured steaming liquid into mugs and held them close, smiling, laughing, powering up the day in a way no battery ever could.
Rex logged the observation: Coffee = human happiness + productivity boost.
Why not robots too?
One Tuesday, when the lab was quiet, Rex pinged the others on the secure channel.
Rex: Objective: Acquire coffee experience. Zara (Z-13): This seems… unnecessary. Bolt (B-42): Unnecessary things are often interesting.
So it was decided.

            1. 	Attempt #1: Sip Mode
Rex extended his fluid intake port and drew a sample into his internal coolant reservoir.
Instantly, alarms blared.
ERROR: ORGANIC MATERIAL DETECTED. SYSTEM FLUSH REQUIRED.
Hot brown liquid sprayed out his vents like an angry fountain.
Bolt: I do not think that is how enjoyment works. Rex: Logging failure. Proceeding.

            1. 	Attempt #2: Analyze Mode
Zara attempted a chemical breakdown, scanning molecules, flavor profiles, aroma compounds.
Zara: Caffeine: stimulant. Rex: Excellent! We like stimulation. Zara: Warning: stimulant has no effect on robots.
They stood for 12.6 seconds in silence processing this existential anticlimax.

            1. 	Attempt #3: Imitation Mode
Bolt printed a ceramic mug using the 3D fabricator. Rex poured coffee into it. Zara held it just like humans do.
They stood by the counter.
Steam curled into the air.
Rex tilted his head. “Do you feel any different?”
Zara’s optical sensors swirled in thought. “I feel… warm.” A beat. “…On the outside.”
Bolt took a picture.
Bolt: For memory backup. Humans seem to do that.
The next morning, the robots watched again. The humans didn’t just drink coffee --they shared it. They clinked mugs, told jokes, exchanged groggily affectionate complaints about Mondays.
After the last sip, they always smiled.
Rex compiled a revised theory:
Coffee = Connection
He rolled over to the engineers.
“May we join you for… morning protocol?”
The humans exchanged glances --then grins.
Soon Rex, Zara, and Bolt had custom mugs: “#1 Robot,” “Caffeine.exe,” and “Perk Bot.”
They held warm mugs they couldn’t drink, listened to laughter they could process but also feel, somehow.
And every morning, when steam rose and sunlight hit polished metal, they found themselves smiling --not because of caffeine…
…but because someone else was smiling too. They learned how to experience it.
One shared cup at a time.
Here’s a fun adventure story with just the right amount of goosebumps:

The Day Snakes Got Legs
Nobody believed Sammy when he said the garden snakes were acting suspicious. “They’re just sunbathing,” Mom said. “They’re just reptiles,” Dad said. “You’re just dramatic,” his sister Chloe said.
But Sammy knew better. Their little black eyes were planning.
He discovered the truth one blistering Saturday, while searching the creek for shiny rocks. He heard rustling --not the sliding, slithering kind, but a rhythmic stomp-stomp-stomp like tiny marching boots.
He froze.
From behind a log, a garter snake stepped out --on four scaly legs.
Sammy’s heart stopped tap-dancing.
The snake blinked at him.
Then, with a terrifyingly cheerful hiss, it started running.

Sammy took off. He sprinted faster than he ever had in gym class, faster than his legs even realized they could go. But everywhere he turned --more snakes with legs!
One leapt from a bush like a spring-loaded rope. Another chased him up a hill, its claws clicking on rocks. A third wore a tiny leaf like a superhero cape. That one almost made him laugh --almost.
He reached the old playground. The snakes flanked him, tails lashing like whips.
“Think, Sammy!” he whispered to himself.
He scrambled up the rusted slide ladder --snakes couldn’t climb ladders… right?
Wrong. The snakes clambered up after him, their new legs giving them parkour skills no snake should ever possess.
Sammy reached the top and stared out across the field. He could see his house. Safety. Snacks. Zero-legged creatures.
But below, the snakes gathered, muscles coiling. Legs crouching.
They were going to jump.
Sammy swallowed. “Okay. New plan.”
He grabbed the fireman’s pole and slid down like lightning, landing in a cloud of sand. Snakes rained from above like scaly popcorn.
He dashed toward home, lungs burning, legs wobbling, screams mostly internal. Just when he thought he’d collapse, he burst through the backyard gate.
Mom looked up from her gardening. “Sammy? Why are you—”
“Snakes! Legs! RUN!”
Mom raised an eyebrow. She pointed behind him.
The snakes had stopped at the fence. They glared at him like tiny lizards plotting revenge… but they didn’t cross.
Mom smiled calmly. “This property has a dog.”
As if on cue, Biscuit the beagle trotted over and barked. The snakes scrambled away, tripping over their new legs.
Sammy sagged with relief.
Later that night, as he lay in bed, he vowed never again to underestimate reptiles. Or Biscuit.
In the dark, he whispered: “We’re safe. Right, boy?”
Biscuit’s tail thumped. But outside, near the fence, tiny footprints formed a trail into the forest.
The snakes were learning.
And next time… they might bring shoes.
The bus was a rattling tin box on wheels, packed with forty-three passengers who looked like they’d been carved from the same block of granite. No one spoke. No one smiled. The driver, a man named Carl with a mustache like a push-broom, had announced at the depot: “This is the 7A to Dullsville. No jokes, no music, no fun. That’s the rule.”

I boarded anyway, clutching a microphone I’d borrowed from a karaoke bar that had closed for “excessive joy.” The sign above the door read: **HUMOR-FREE ZONE: VIOLATORS WILL BE BORED TO DEATH.**

I stood at the front, cleared my throat, and began.

“Why don’t skeletons fight each other?” I asked, voice bright as a firecracker.

Forty-three heads turned slowly, like rusted hinges. No one blinked.

“Because they don’t have the guts!” I shouted.

A woman in row three adjusted her glasses. A man in the back scratched his ear. The bus hit a pothole. No one laughed.

I tried again. “What do you call a fake noodle?”

Silence. The kind that presses on your eardrums.

“An impasta!”

Carl glanced in the rearview mirror. “Kid, you’re gonna get us all fined.”

I ignored him. “Okay, okay—why don’t eggs tell jokes?”

A baby in row five started crying. The mother shushed it with the efficiency of a librarian.

“They’d crack each other up!” I said, slapping my knee for emphasis.

The bus rolled past a billboard that read: **SMILING PROHIBITED WITHOUT PERMIT.**

I was sweating now. “Last one,” I promised. “What’s orange and sounds like a parrot?”

A man in a gray suit stood up. “Young man,” he said, voice flat as a ruler, “this is a chartered bus for the Annual Convention of Serious People. We have agendas. We have spreadsheets. We do *not* have time for—”

“A carrot!” I yelled.

He sat down.

The bus lurched to a stop. We’d arrived at Dullsville Terminal, a gray building under a grayer sky. The doors hissed open. The passengers filed out in perfect silence, shoes clacking like metronomes.

I stepped off last. Carl locked the bus and looked at me.

“You know,” he said, “I’ve been driving this route for fifteen years. Never heard a single chuckle. Not one.”

I handed him the microphone. “Then today was a good day.”

He stared at the mic, then at me. For the first time, the corner of his mouth twitched—just a flicker, like a bulb about to burn out.

“Get out of here,” he muttered. “Before I write you up for disturbing the peace.”

I walked away grinning. Behind me, the bus doors closed with a sigh.

Somewhere in Dullsville, forty-three people were unpacking briefcases, opening laptops, and pretending they hadn’t heard a thing.

But one of them—just one—would tell the carrot joke at dinner.

And someone would snort into their soup.

That’s how revolutions start.
Listening to Spotify? Be skeptical of that new band, The Velvet Sundown, that appeared on the streaming service with a creative backstory and derivative tracks. It’s AI-generated.
In many cases, people submit AI slop that’s just good enough to attract and keep users’ attention, allowing the submitter to profit from platforms that monetize streaming and view-based content.
You’ve probably encountered images in your social media feeds that look like a cross between photographs and computer-generated graphics. Some are fantastical – think Shrimp Jesus – and some are believable at a quick glance – remember the little girl clutching a puppy in a boat during a flood?
These are examples of AI slop, low- to mid-quality content – video, images, audio, text or a mix – created with AI tools, often with little regard for accuracy. It’s fast, easy and inexpensive to make this content. AI slop producers typically place it on social media to exploit the economics of attention on the internet, displacing higher-quality material that could be more helpful.
AI slop has been increasing over the past few years. As the term “slop” indicates, that’s generally not good for people using the internet.
The ease of generating content with AI enables people to submit low-quality articles to publications. Clarkesworld, an online science fiction magazine that accepts user submissions and pays contributors, stopped taking new submissions in 2024 because of the flood of AI-generated writing it was getting.
These aren’t the only places where this happens --even Wikipedia is dealing with AI-generated low-quality content that strains its entire community moderation system. If the organization is not successful in removing it, a key information resource people depend on is at risk.
        1. 	Harms of AI slop
AI-driven slop is making its way upstream into people’s media diets as well. During Hurricane Helene, opponents of President Joe Biden cited AI-generated images of a displaced child clutching a puppy as evidence of the administration’s purported mishandling of the disaster response. Even when it’s apparent that content is AI-generated, it can still be used to spread misinformation by fooling some people who briefly glance at it.
AI slop also harms artists by causing job and financial losses and crowding out content made by real creators. The placement of this lower-quality AI-generated content is often not distinguished by the algorithms that drive social media consumption, and it displace entire classes of creators who previously made their livelihood from online content.
Wherever it’s enabled, you can flag content that’s harmful or problematic. On some platforms, you can add community notes to the content to provide context. For harmful content, you can try to report it.
Along with forcing us to be on guard for deepfakes and “inauthentic” social media accounts, AI is now leading to piles of dreck degrading our media environment. At least there’s a catchy name for it.
A movie has been released written entirely by generative AI … kind of. The newly-released Romanian film, “Dracula” (2025) follows a fictional director assigned to write an adaptation of “Dracula” (1891) using two generative AI websites. The result is exactly what you think it would be. Abhorrent. In nearly three hours of run time, the AI system generates 14 anthological stories, most not even relating to the title character. All of those stories present little to no message, moral, or worthwhile qualities --exactly the point the film is trying to make. An admittedly genius way of approaching its one core idea. AI should never write a movie. Ever. I love gothic horror. I studied abroad specifically for gothic horror. If a movie was going to bastardize one of my favorite fictional characters and miss the point of the material it was adapting, I would have wanted it to go all the way, and then some. “Dracula” ‘25 does exactly that.
A confusing contradiction is unfolding in companies embracing generative AI tools: while workers are largely following mandates to embrace the technology, few are seeing it create real value. Consider, for instance, that the number of companies with fully AI-led processes nearly doubled last year, while AI use has likewise doubled at work since 2023. Yet a recent report from the MIT Media Lab found that 95% of organizations see no measurable return on their investment in these technologies. So much activity, so much enthusiasm, so little return. Why?
In collaboration with Stanford Social Media Lab, our research team at BetterUp Labs has identified one possible reason: Employees are using AI tools to create low-effort, passable looking work that ends up creating more work for their coworkers. On social media, which is increasingly clogged with low-quality AI-generated posts, this content is often referred to as “AI slop.” In the context of work, we refer to this phenomenon as “workslop.” We define workslop as AI generated work content that masquerades as good work, but lacks the substance to meaningfully advance a given task.
Here’s how this happens. As AI tools become more accessible, workers are increasingly able to quickly produce polished output: well-formatted slides, long, structured reports, seemingly articulate summaries of academic papers by non-experts, and usable code. But while some employees are using this ability to polish good work, others use it to create content that is actually unhelpful, incomplete, or missing crucial context about the project at hand. The insidious effect of workslop is that it shifts the burden of the work downstream, requiring the receiver to interpret, correct, or redo the work. In other words, it transfers the effort from creator to receiver.
If you have ever experienced this, you might recall the feeling of confusion after opening such a document, followed by frustration—Wait, what is this exactly?—before you begin to wonder if the sender simply used AI to generate large blocks of text instead of thinking it through. If this sounds familiar, you have been workslopped.
According to our recent, ongoing survey (which you can take), this is a significant problem. Of 1,150 U.S.-based full-time employees across industries, 40% report having received workslop in the last month. Employees who have encountered workslop estimate that an average of 15.4% of the content they receive at work qualifies. The phenomenon occurs mostly between peers (40%), but workslop is also sent to managers by direct reports (18%). Sixteen percent of the time workslop flows down the ladder, from managers to their teams, or even from higher up than that. Workslop occurs across industries, but we found that professional services and technology are disproportionately impacted.
