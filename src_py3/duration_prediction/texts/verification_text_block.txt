Heres a short, surreal adventure story with the twist you asked for:

Falling Into the Moon

Elara always thought the moon was a quiet place  cold, distant, a silver coin glued to the night. But on the evening she fell into it, she realized the moon was more like a door.

It began with a telescope. She was on the roof, sketching constellations, when something in the moonlight shimmered  a ripple, like heat above a road. She leaned closer over the edge of her skylight to adjust the focus

and the ladder slipped.

There was a breathless moment of falling  she squeezed her eyes shut, waiting for the slam of roof tiles or grass  but instead she felt weightless. The air thinned into silver dust. And when she opened her eyes, she was plummeting upward.

Past the clouds.
Past the stars.
Past the edge of everything she knew.

The moon grew enormous, detailed: not smooth, not dead, but alive with swirling grooves and glowing cracks. It yawned open like a whales mouth.

She tumbled through the shining surface 
Splash.

Inside was not rock, but a sea of soft, glowing powder that cushioned her fall. It smelled like cold rain and forgotten wishes. Lunar fish swam overhead  ribbonlike creatures with craters for eyes. A fox made of starlight tapped her shoe, then darted away, leaving tiny meteors where its paws touched.

Hello? Elara called, her voice bouncing like a rubber ball in the vast space.

Echoes answered:
*hello hello hello
But some of them changed shape:
*welcome weve been waiting

She followed winding staircases etched in moonmilk stone. She passed lanterns that held fragments of dreams  someone learning to fly, someone dancing above a lake, someone holding a hand theyd lost long ago. Perhaps the moon collected the things people wished for but never spoke.

At the heart of it all was a grand, circular hall  the interior of the full moon. A throne of light sat empty, as if saving a seat for someone who never arrived.

A gentle voice swirled out of the walls:

The moon doesnt just pull the tides,** it said. **It pulls those who wonder.

Elara felt a flutter in her chest  awe, terror, excitement. But outside, Earth waited. Her roof. Her telescope. Her life.

The moon seemed to sigh.

The glowing powder rose like a tide and swept her upward. Elara shot back through the silver surface and fell  this time down  through clouds and air and gravity, landing safely on her roof with only a soft thump.

The moon hung above her  ordinary again. Silent.

Elara touched her pocket and found a tiny stone shaped like a crescent. It pulsed faintly, warm.

She smiled.

She knew the truth now:
The moon wasnt distant.
It was listening.
And if she ever wondered hard enough again

it would be waiting.
